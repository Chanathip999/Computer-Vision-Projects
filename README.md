## Overview

This repository contains projects that leverage computer vision techniques to solve real-world problems. Our primary projects include:

- **Face Detection**: Implementing algorithms to accurately detect human faces in images and videos.
- **Lane Detection**: Utilizing image processing to identify and track lane markers on roads for autonomous driving applications.

## Projects

### Face Detection

Our face detection project aims to accurately identify and locate human faces in various image and video contexts. Key features include:

- **Robust Detection**: Handles different lighting conditions and facial orientations.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Capable of detecting faces in real-time video streams.
- **Multiple Frameworks**: Implemented using popular libraries such as OpenCV and dlib.

### Lane Detection

The lane detection project focuses on identifying road lanes to assist with autonomous driving technologies. Key features include:

- **Edge Detection**: Uses advanced algorithms to highlight lane markers.
- **Perspective Transformation**: Applies geometric transformations to better visualize lanes.
- **Video Analysis**: Processes video feeds to continuously track lane positions.

## Getting Started
